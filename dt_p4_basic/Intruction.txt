Note: this simulation is to test the use of rf model inside p4-enabled switch. The model is traine dand tested on the same data portion.

Steps:
1. Run rn.sh to start the simulation
2. Run rn2.sh to split train and test data, train model, translate its output to switch, send traffic and monitor the results
